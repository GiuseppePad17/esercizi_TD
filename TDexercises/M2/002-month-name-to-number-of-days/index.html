        Month Name to Number of Days
        The length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days.
        In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string.
        Then your program should display the number of days in that month.
        Display 28 or 29 days for February so that leap years are addressed.

        Example:
        Input = April
        Output = 30
    </p>
    <script src="./numberDays.js"></script>
